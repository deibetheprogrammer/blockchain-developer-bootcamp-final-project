This dapp should allow users to participate in a simple lottery
 
Here's my take on what the workflow should look like:
 
1. An administrator creates an event, allowing users to participate in a lottery.
2. Admissions close so nobody can register anymore.
3. A winner is selected randomly, and he takes everone else's money.
4. The event is closed.
