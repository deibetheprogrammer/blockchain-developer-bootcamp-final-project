# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

This project is directed to be used in e-sports settings.
This dapp should allow a money match event to be created and users should be able to bet on who they think will win.
 
Here's my take on what the workflow should look like:
 
1. An administrator creates the event, registering the opposing parties.
2. Once the event is created, users can place their bets.
3. When the match is over, money will be distributed between the administrator, the competitors and the users.
